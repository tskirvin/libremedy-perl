libremedy-perl (0.13.05) lenny UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Warning about "don't know where the item was created" is now a debug 
    message.
  * More fixes to actually return debugging error (removing 'local $@')
  * Config.pm - default cache location is now /var/lib/remedy/cache
  * Cache.pm - added some logging around set_value () (trying to narrow
    down some cache corruption issues).
  * Session/ARS.pm - GetField () cache was returning a dereferenced hash
    instead of the hash itself.  I'm not sure why it ever worked.
