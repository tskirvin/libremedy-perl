* Tasks, such as 'TAS000000000123' (TAS000000000416).

* remedy-close should invoke tkt_assign() if necessary.

* "-m" option for cvs/svn/rcs-like commit text

* standardize command-line flags

* when remctl stdin/stdout works:
    - stdin for text of changes
    - worklog should log to newsgroup with more text
    - 'client-contact' to start an actual email

* 'all' functionality - get groups to search for out of a given user, and
  proceed to do scans based on that information.
        remedy-list -t unassigned --all-groups -u jonpilat

* 'set pending' for the status field 

* Simple 'reassign to ITS Help Desk Level 2' option, probably with aliases
  for common groups; also wildcard searches for groups

* remake 'pending ' - set Status to Pending, Status Reason to "Client Action
  Required."

* From vdc:

  Can we say, if someone closes a ticket, the one closing the ticket must be
  assigned to the ticket, or if there's no assignee, it automagically gets
  assigned to them?

* "Number of hours worked" on assign/close
